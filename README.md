# Reinforcement-Learning-Approaches-to-Blackjack
Integrated Reinforcement Learning (Q-learning) with traditional card counting to optimize Blackjack strategies. Incorporated rule variations and utilized Hi-Lo and Zen count systems, improving win rates. Explored RL adaptability to dynamically adjust strategies based on game state.

This paper investigates the application of combining reinforcement learning with counting systems to optimize blackjack. The principal aim is to utilize reinforcement learning to enhance the basic strategy for blackjack and determine its viability for implementing an effective algorithm. First, we have implemented a Q-learning algorithm to enhance the basic blackjack strategy, which proved to be dramatically improved in performance. Then we have implemented two rule variations. Next, we study the effects of adding rule variations into the basic strategy. Then, the high-low counting system was implemented for the complete point count system. To enhance performance even more, we added the Zen count system. By now, two different rule variations are being acted on and results are examined. Our experiments report the pros and cons of the approaches, offering an understanding of the difference in rule sets. The results indicate that incorporating of reinforcement learning into blackjack can greatly improve the performance of a blackjack player.
