# Reinforcement-Learning-Approaches-to-Blackjack
Integrated Reinforcement Learning (Q-learning) with traditional card counting to optimize Blackjack strategies. Incorporated rule variations and utilized Hi-Lo and Zen count systems, improving win rates. Explored RL adaptability to dynamically adjust strategies based on game state.

Developed a system that integrates Reinforcement Learning (RL) with traditional card counting techniques to optimize strategies in Blackjack.
Implemented Q-learning to improve the basic Blackjack strategy, incorporating rule variations such as 'Dealer Hits on Soft 17' and 'Early Surrender'. 
Utilized the Hi-Lo and Zen count systems alongside Q-learning to refine decision-making processes, resulting in improved win rates.
The project explored the adaptability of RL in dynamically adjusting strategies based on game state, providing insights into advanced techniques for enhancing strategic decision-making in Blackjack.
